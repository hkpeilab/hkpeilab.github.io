The value created will be fairly and transparently allocated according to the consensus of all users.\nContributions In this project, to promote and incentivize knowledge sharing and retrieving worldwide for Web 3.0, we will construct the first trustworthy and privacy-preserving decentralized knowledge graph system. The system will be composed of three layers. In the first layer, the users who want to share knowledge can store their data in the distributed storage system provided by HUAWEI Cloud. The data will be encrypted for the privacy of knowledge owners. In the second layer, we will construct an authenticated data structure for verifiable knowledge retrieving on the global knowledge graph shared by the users worldwide in a privacy-preserving manner. In the top layer, we will develop a decentralized social identity (DID) platform to regulate users' behaviors and encourage sharing of valuable knowledge for a sustainable ecosystem. Most importantly, all the above operations of storing, integrating, and retrieving knowledge will be supported by the Blockchain Service provided by HUAWEI Cloud; thus, they can be guaranteed transparently, tamper-proof, and openness.\nSignificance The project can return the ownership of knowledge to users and break the monopoly of large Internet technology companies. The Knowledge Web and its Web of Knowledge are created and accessed by numerous Web users and becoming decentralized, which can be extended to a broad range of decentralized applications, including healthcare, finance, and autonomous organization, in the future.\nContent in this demo Video: Knowledge Ocean\n","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1665126078,"objectID":"882e6df9f99aae610105e53ad1ae7ae6","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/demos/knowledge-ocean/","publishdate":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/demos/knowledge-ocean/","section":"demos","summary":"Helping the Public break the Monopoly of Knowledge with Blockchain and Web3.0","tags":null,"title":"✨ Knowledge Ocean","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Table of Contents  Problem overview Solutions Content in this demo    Problem overview  Spinal and back problems are known to irk many urbanites and potentially cause developmental, immunity, neural, cardiopulmonary, or digestive disorders.

Unfortunately, such a mechanism is unsuitable for large transformer models due to the prohibitive training costs and excessive I/O delay. We introduce OTAS, the first elastic serving system specially tailored for transformer models by exploring lightweight token management. We develop a novel idea called token adaptation. To cope with fluctuating query loads and diverse user requests, we enhance OTAS with application-aware selective batching and online token adaptation.\nPrototype Overview We use Python to process the incoming queries and PyTorch to define the neural networks. We build the transformer model with timm library and insert two modules to add and remove the processing tokens at each layer. The system enables users to make a query and register tasks with two interfaces. The Make Query interface processes a query that comprises an image sample and various attributes. The Register Task interface saves the task parameters in the task model list and the corresponding latency and utility values in the task data list.\n  ","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"3c154a3ff35f8513b51fc2b527d57d4c","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/project/an-elastic-transformer-serving-system-for-foundation-model-via-token-adaptation-%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/an-elastic-transformer-serving-system-for-foundation-model-via-token-adaptation-%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC/","section":"project","summary":"Transformer model empowered architectures have become a pillar of cloud services that keeps reshaping our society.

This trend not only spurs the recent popularity of the Computing and Network Convergence (CNC), but also introduces an urgent need for the intelligentization of a management platform to coordinate changing resources and tasks in the CNC. Therefore, we present the concept of an intelligence-endogenous management platform for CNCs called CNC brain based on artificial intelligence technologies. It aims at efficiently and automatically matching the supply and demand with high heterogeneity in a CNC via four key building blocks, i.e., perception, scheduling, adaptation, and governance, throughout the CNC\u0026rsquo;s life cycle. Their functionalities, goals, and challenges are presented.\nPrototype Overview To examine the effectiveness of the proposed concept and framework, we also implement a prototype for the CNC brain based on a deep reinforcement learning technology. Also, it is evaluated on a CNC testbed that integrates three open-source and popular frameworks (OpenFaas, Kubernetes, and Ethereum) and a real-world business dataset provided by Microsoft Azure. The evaluation results prove the prototype\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness in terms of resource utilization and performance.

This paper investigates the security threats posed by malicious PLMs to these emerging database middlewares. We specifically propose a novel type of Trojan attack, where a maliciously designed PLM causes unexpected behavior in the database middleware. These Trojan attacks possess the following characteristics: (1) Triggerability: The Trojan-infected database middleware will function normally with normal input, but will likely malfunction when triggered by the attacker. (2) Imperceptibility: There is no need for noticeable modification of the input to trigger the Trojan. (3) Generalizability: The Trojan is capable of targeting a variety of downstream tasks, not just one specific task. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of these Trojan attacks through experiments and analyze potential countermeasures and their limitations. Our findings could aid in the creation of stronger mechanisms for the implementation of PLMs in database middleware.\n","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694677512,"objectID":"c3f03b2139950e60421970e93d20da26","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/project/investigating-trojan-attacks-on-pre-trained-language-model-powered-database-middleware/","publishdate":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/investigating-trojan-attacks-on-pre-trained-language-model-powered-database-middleware/","section":"project","summary":"The recent success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as BERT has resulted in the development of various beneficial database middlewares, including natural language query interfaces and entity matching.

Unfortunately, most existing works do not work well because they still need to load models into containers from scratch, which is the bottleneck based on our observations. Therefore, we propose a low-latency serverless ML inference system called Optimus via a new container management scheme.\nPrototype Overview Optimus API and communication between clients and the gateway are implemented in REST API format. Clients can invoke an inference procedure by sending an HTTP request containing the model name and input data. Optimus stores the trained models in a Docker volume that is attached directly to each container created by the system. Models are deployed to the Docker volume in HDF format. Model structure information and model-to-model transformation planing are stored with the models in JSON format. On the host machine, a gateway service runs as the container manager. It uses the Docker SDK for Python to create, run, and remove containers in the local Docker environment.

They have been shown to be useful not only for traffic management and control, but also for diverse innovative applications to improve people’s quality of life. Observing that the most popular and omnipresent things in any city are vehicles, if each vehicle is equipped with powerful capability in communications, computing, storage, and intelligence (CCSI capability), such vehicles roaming around a city will automatically form a dynamic web of sensing, computing, communications, control, and/or edge intelligence, potentially providing an economically sound alternative solution to realizing the vision of smart city. In this talk, the speaker will discuss how to leverage connected CCSI enabled vehicles to take full advantage of both vehicular mobility and spectrum/computing opportunity to beef up the edge for various kinds of smart city services.\n","date":1652054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653303409,"objectID":"15ae7a2e8567de514fa45cb23e3f7012","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/workshop/talk2/","publishdate":"2022-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshop/talk2/","section":"workshop","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Task Scheduling for Multi-Access Edge Computing in IRS-Aided Vehicular Networks Nei Kato, Professor, Fellow of Engineering Academy of Japan, IEEE, IEICE\nGraduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University\nNei Kato is a full professor and the Dean with Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University.

The computation tasks of intelligent applications can be offloaded to and processed by near-end-user MEC servers to meet strict latency requirements. However, the latency of provided services is dependent on MEC processor scheduling and millimeter wave (mmWave) transmission conditions for the urban B5G vehicular networks. To alleviate the mmWave signal attenuation caused by buildings, Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) has been regarded as efficient and prospective infrastructure. In this paper, we study the IRS-aided MEC-served vehicular networks and analyze the relationship between computation resource allocation and offloading policy at an intersection. Considering the vehicle mobility patterns, transmission conditions, and task sizes, we optimize the task scheduling by improving the allocation of limited processors and IRS resource. Moreover, the mutual interference among concurrent transmissions is taken into account. In this presentation, by assuming the moving directions available, a dynamic task scheduling algorithm is presented which considers both the communications and computations. The simulation results illustrate that the new scheme outperforms benchmark methods in terms of task offloading rate, computing rate, and finish rate for the IRS-aided MEC-served vehicular networks.\n","date":1651968e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653303409,"objectID":"4eb9bc6ce0b7955e95e90679b86250b2","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/workshop/talk3/","publishdate":"2022-05-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshop/talk3/","section":"workshop","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"AIoT as a Service – Framework, Opportunities, and Challenges Victor C.M.

Realizing AIoT will require massive investments in infrastructure, and lessons learned from network deployments point to the use of shared hardware and software resources that can be virtualized to support various services on demand, resulting in AIoT-as-a-Service (AIoTaaS). In this talk, we start with a review of the idea of Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS), leading to IoTaaS and AIaaS, which form the basis of AIoTaaS. We present a framework for AIoTaaS, which incorporates edge and cloud computing platforms to support the AI functionalities required for different services. Enabled by cloud and edge computing, AIoTaaS can effectively implement machine learning (ML) training and inference functions on cloud and edge devices with much less complexity to enable efficient and effective AI decision making in IoT and data analytics, especially in the area of streaming data and real-time analytics associated with edge computing networks. To implement AIoTaaS, interoperability between components at the device level, software level and platform level should be extended while optimizing system and network operations as well as extracting value from data. In the future, AIoTaaS integrated with 5G and blockchain will be leveraged to achieve more efficient IoT operations, improve human-machine interactions, and enhance data management and analytics, creating a foundation for pervasive AI services and applications.\n","date":1651881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653309230,"objectID":"6442f67948dd2922e3f8c258e0b013d4","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/workshop/talk4/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshop/talk4/","section":"workshop","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Edge-AI and Mission-critical Industrial Applications Albert Y.

There is a broad agreement that the deployment of computing resources close to where data is created is more business-friendly, as it can address system latency, privacy, cost, and resiliency challenges that a pure cloud computing approach cannot address. This computing paradigm is now known as Edge Computing. Having said that, the full potential of this transformation for both of computing and data analytics is far from being realized. The industrial requirements are much more stringent than what a simple edge computing paradigm can deliver. This is particularly true when mission-critical industrial applications have strict requirements on real-time decision making, operational technology innovation, data privacy, and running environment. In this talk, I aim to provide a few answers by combining real-time computing strengths into modern data- and intelligence-rich computing ecosystems. I will also explore the topic of Edge AI, which is a process in which the Edge systems uses machine learning algorithms to process data generated by the user’s devices.\nSlides: [Edge-AI and Mission-critical Industrial Applications]\n","date":1651795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655643785,"objectID":"51f2839f05d97a12e3b410f3bfeb339c","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/workshop/talk5/","publishdate":"2022-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshop/talk5/","section":"workshop","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"区块链 – 零信任之上的共识 Xiuzhen Cheng 成秀珍, Professor, Fellow of IEEE\nSchool of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University\n成秀珍教授现担任山东大学计算机科学与技术学院院长及山东省数链融合技术创新中心主任，是IEEE Fellow、国家高层次海外人才、国家重点研发计划首席科学家、山东省“泰山学者”海外特聘专家。成教授于1991年本科毕业于国防科技大学电子工程系， 2002年博士毕业于美国明尼苏达大学双城分校计算机科学系。从2002到2020年在美国乔治华盛顿大学历任助理教授、终身副教授、终身教授。现主要研究方向为安全与隐私保护、区块链理论与应用、物联网与边缘计算等。曾担任（或正在担任)多家期刊编委及多个国际会议主席，是中国计算机学会推荐国际学术会议WASA的创办者和山大- Elsevier国际期刊《High-Confidence Computing》的创刊主编。\nAbstract: 本报告主要回答两个问题：1、为什么说区块链的本质是零信任情况下实现多主体间成功协作的技术；2、拓展区块链应用面临哪些挑战。最后介绍一下我们在区块链方向上所做的一些工作。\nSlides: 零信任计算 成秀珍\n","date":1651708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654069634,"objectID":"26e82b36d5bd65522461cec894407327","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/workshop/talk6/","publishdate":"2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshop/talk6/","section":"workshop","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Edge Intelligence and V2X Enabled Autonomous Driving Jianping Wang, Professor\nDepartment of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong\nProf. Jianping Wang is currently a professor in the Department of Computer Science at the City University of Hong Kong and the assistant provost (Strategic Planning and Quality Assurance).

Introduction Modern machine learning (ML) applications are often deployed in the cloud environment to exploit the computational power of clusters. However, this in-cloud computing scheme cannot satisfy the demands of emerging edge intelligence scenarios, including providing personalized models, protecting user privacy, adapting to real-time tasks and saving resource costs. To conquer the limitations of conventional in-cloud computing, it comes the rise of on-device learning, which handles the end-to-end ML procedure mainly on user devices, and restricts unnecessary involvement of the cloud. Despite the promising advantages of on-device learning, implementing a high-performance on-device learning system still faces many severe challenges, such as insufficient user training data, backward propagation blocking and limited peak processing speed.\nIllustration: Conventional ML applications rely on the in-cloud learning paradigm, incurring essential drawbacks. Upgrading to the TinyML paradigm can effectively address these issues.\n2. Architecture Overview Observing the substantial improvement space in the implementation and acceleration of on-device learning systems, our group devote to designing high-performance TinyML architectures and relevant optimization algorithms, especially for embedded devices and microprocessors. Our research focuses on the software and hardware synergy of on-device learning techniques, covering the scope of model-level neural network design, algorithm-level training optimization and hardware-level instruction acceleration. Here, we present the architecture overview of our system design.\n  Architecture Overview  Illustration: an efficient TinyML system require a holistic design of the entire hierarchy, which can be resolved as five key research opportunities.\n3. Research Opportunities Here are five key research opportunities to implement our system. Please check the sub-folders for details.\n4. Achievements The on-device learning techniques can be employed in many emerging TinyML scenarios, where the system performance is often bounded by the limited hardware resources. Currently, our group has achieved breakthroughs in improving the computational capacity and designing domain-specific AI chips for task acceleration. These chips can be designed from the perspectives of model compression, few-shot learning, quantization-ware training, memory management and low-level instructions. We pursue the vision that helps researchers and developers optimize AI deployment without tedious code modifications.

A high- performance on-device learning system requires breaking the constraints of limited resources and alleviating computational overhead. Our preliminary work shows that employing the 8-bit fixed-point (INT8) quantization in both forward and back- ward passes over a deep model is a promising way to enable tiny on-device learning in practice. The key to an efficient quantization-aware training (QAT) method is to exploit the hardware- level enabled acceleration while preserving the training quality in each layer. However, off-the-shelf quantization methods cannot handle the on-device learning paradigm of fixed-point processing. To overcome these challenges, we propose to design an adaptive QAT algorithm, which jointly optimizes the computation of forward and backward passes. Besides, we need to build efficient network components to automatically counteract the quantization error of tensor arithmetic.

Unlike previous methods aiming at improving bandwidth utilization or using an unstructured pixel-wise compression, we jointly capture the channel and spatial-level feature redundancy, and conduct a hierarchical compression in these two levels to achieve a much higher traffic reduction ratio. Specifically, we need to design a more efficient feature compression method to leverage the pixel similarity, and reorganize the features into groups based on channel significance to prune the network. Meanwhile, we intend to calibrate the gradients of compressed features with a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the convergence rate.

Existing methods mainly use convolutional neural networks as the backbone and get limited local features to recover the occluded part. Such an anti-occlusion pipeline often suffers from the challenges of self-occlusion scenery, where similar parts of occluders and occludes are ambiguous. In this case, we need to design a masked visual autoencoder for image processing and video streaming, which recovers occluded regions by extracting deep spatial information at a higher semantic level. This autoencoder can get better details inferred from global self-attention and thus improves accuracy. The gist is to train the autoencoder to extract key-point information from the key patches that are manually masked in a self-supervised manner to simulate the occlusion in video streaming. To choose the patches that should be masked, we design a high-capacity learnable gate that can extract contrastive representation, i.e., distinguish important feature regions and background regions, to generate a binary mask by randomly choosing a part of feature patches. We also propose an end-to-end pipeline for training and inference, which can effectively reduce the dependency of annotated occluded datasets and can be further applied to other visual tasks.

According to the survey and statistics of China Child Development Center, more than 20% teens have scoliosis. In addition to myopia and obesity, scoliosis has become the third biggest killer of youth health. According to some relevant survey data, 60% of teenagers have different degrees of posture problems. Early prevention and early treatment is the key of adolescent posture problems. Children who have mild scoliosis need to be monitored closely, usually with X-rays,to see if the curve is getting worse.\nAt present, the mainstream screening method is still manual detection, which has require patient naturally stands and bends at 90 degrees and the doctor makes a judgment based on the spinal line and morphological changes. However, such method has low efficiency and low accuracy and facing the severe shortage of physiotherapists.\nMeanwhile, during the COVID-19 epidemic, to help more people with rehabilitation needs realize remote screening and tracking and real-time AI monitoring of sports rehabilitation at home. A mobile-based posture screening algorithm and real-time exercise rehabilitation tracking algorithm are proposed.\nIn this project, we will design a 3D back image analysis method using commercial RGB-D to achieve low-cost, non-radiation, and sufficient accuracy of spine analysis and scoliosis screening. However, the analysis of the back image based on RGB-D is not simple and has the following three major challenges: (1) The back of the human body is an irregular curved surface, which is difficult to describe with some parametric models. (2) The point cloud image measured by commercial sensors is relatively sparse and has strong noise, and it is difficult to directly obtain the shape of the back. (3) The relationship between the back image and the spine shape is fuzzy.\n  Hardware Design and Compoments  To address these challenges, we propose an automated all-in-one machine that performs comprehensive and accurate analysis, evaluation, and diagnosis of human posture: analysis items are in addition to common body dimensions. It also includes three-dimensional reconstruction of human spine based on infrared, foot pressure analysis, XO legs, pelvic deformation analysis and other functions; it is a set of comprehensive posture evaluation system with clinical significance in the real sense.\n  Posture analysis algorithms  We also develop a Dr. Body APP, which uses AI algorithm to screen scoliosis, XO legs, high and low shoulders and other unhealthy postures through the photos of the back of the human body of the mobile phone for screening and severity classification; the use of a single photo of the human body for three-dimensional reconstruction of the human body for posture analysis and dimension measurement; Provide users with a variety of sports rehabilitation online courses, and record sports videos for intelligent action correction and analysis.\n  App record user data and provide personalized follow-up service  Innovation competition awards:\nFirst Prize of Hong Kong University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition (2020); Hong Kong Social Enterprise Competition (HKSEC2019) Intellectual Property Ambassador Award; \u0026ldquo;Weining Cup\u0026rdquo; International AI Medical Challenge First Prize (2019), et.\n","date":1648339200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650557796,"objectID":"8b154bffad168f104ad8525a2cbdbe98","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/project/radiation-free-spine-reconstruction-and-posture-analysis-techniques-with-3d-imaging/","publishdate":"2022-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/radiation-free-spine-reconstruction-and-posture-analysis-techniques-with-3d-imaging/","section":"project","summary":"Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that occurs most often during thegrowth spurt just before puberty.

Besides, the participants are usually resource-constrained with limited computational power, storage capacity, transmission range and battery. It is essential to design novel training framework to address above challenges.

To deal with the serious performance degradation brought by cross-shard transactions. Therefore, we propose a novel layered sharding architecture for blockchain and a cooperation-based layered sharding consensus. The basic idea is to allow shards to overlap, rather than isolating them completely, so that some nodes can locate in more than one shard.

PSSE consist of a program of curve-specific exercise protocols which are individually adapted to a patients’ curve site, magnitude, and clinical characteristics. Specific PSSE are used to help relieve scoliosis symptoms. PSSE is not generalized physiotherapy exercises which are generic exercises usually consisting of low impact stretching and strengthening activities like yoga, Pilates and the Alexander technique but especially designed exercise for scoliosis patients that requires professional guidance. Wrong movement may cause severe damage to the spine again.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Exercise at specific medical centres with crowd around is risky. Smart phone, however, is now prevalence all over the world. Almost every smart phone contains at least one 2D camera that can capture video stream. If we can use this device to track patients’ movement, it may be way more convenient for doctors to guide the patients remotely.\nHuman pose estimation is one of the best matches of tracking patient movement at home.\nRecent years have witnessed learning-based human pose estimation getting popular in more scenarios with occlusions, where invisible areas for perception objects significantly affect accuracy. Existing methods mainly use convolutional neural networks as the backbone and get limited local features to recover the occluded part. Such an anti-occlusion pipeline often suffers from the challenges of self-occlusion scenery, where similar parts of occluders and occludees are ambiguous. In this case, we need to design a masked visual autoencoder for image processing and video streaming, which recovers occluded regions by extracting deep spatial information at a higher semantic level. This autoencoder can get better details inferred from global self-attention and thus improves accuracy. The gist is to train the autoencoder to extract key-point information from the joint tokens that are manually masked in a self-supervised manner to simulate the occlusion in video streaming. To use dataset more efficiently and extract more information from a single image, we generate several different positive samples simulating more occluded cases by randomly mask more patches in joint tokens. We also propose an end-to-end pipeline for training and inference, which can effectively reduce the dependency of annotated occluded datasets and can be further applied to other visual tasks. This pipeline can obtain a great computation saving with much fewer annotated datasets and hold a higher runtime performance over the SOTA ViT methods.\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650557796,"objectID":"c4fe3ef94d2a997b3319b4d2407b539f","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/project/anti-occlusion-human-pose-estimation-for-scoliosis-rehabilitation/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/anti-occlusion-human-pose-estimation-for-scoliosis-rehabilitation/","section":"project","summary":"Physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises (PSSE) have been proved to be effective in scoliosis rehabilitation.

becoming more and more popular. The key goal is to ensure the safety of drivers and passengers in the vehicle, and it is an essential step to realize autonomous driving at this stage.\nProposed Solution  Cognitive science, human facial expression, and eye tracking with AI Video Analytics Detection System. To build up an AI model for evaluating the driving mental factors and driving behavior of driver to provide the alert signal for human-computer interaction. Quantify Similarity of individual data to the Common Patterns Using Machine Learning Methods (i.e., log likelihoods of data being generated by models).  Methodology  Follow the previous research – In Psychology, HKU perform power analysis to determine the sample size (number of participants) required for detecting an effect, it have multiple predictors. Mental factors features were identified in the previous research assuming a medium effect size (alpha 0.05 and 80% Power). Big data collection in this project – Taxi Driver (at least 500 hours road driving video record) (e.g.: The Taxi driver who have been deducted the driving marks, in traffic jam situation). Feature labelling - facial expression, texture, eye tracking, facial muscle change. Train up the database.  Incentive Factors  Fanling Taxi Company (Mobile Shop Group Limited) supports this project, the camera can be installed in the Taxi to capture the real data (e.g.: angry or suddenly emotion change etc.) for analysis. Mr. Wong (Director of Fanling Taxi Company) stated that his team want to join the Taxi Service Commendations Scheme and seek the technology to improve their quality of service. He and his team are to thirst for joining the trial.

In 2020, the competition drew 6.32 million participants (1.48 million teams) from 4,146 colleges and universities in 124 countries and regions. Over 1,000 professionals were invited to judge the competition and mentor the participants, among whom were investors, entrepreneurs, startup incubator mentors, and innovation and entrepreneurship education experts from China and abroad. Many high-quality projects stood out, gaining market visibility and investment.\nMore than half of the top 100 universities in the world participated in this competition. The quality of the competition hit a record high, and the proportion of silver medals and above awards in the competition was about 0.03%.\nAbout the \u0026ldquo;Challenge Cup\u0026rdquo; Contest The \u0026ldquo;Challenge Cup\u0026rdquo; contest, initiated in 1989, has attracted submissions by about one million students from colleges and universities in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. As a national guide and authoritative competition, the Challenge Cup is known as the \u0026ldquo;Olympics\u0026rdquo; of science and technology for Chinese college students. It is also a window to show Chinese college students' creativity in science and technology and an arena to select students of high quality.\nAward Certificate   Certificate of Internet+ Contest    Certificate of Challenge Cup Contest ","date":1618185600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618201835,"objectID":"0e093f47c9c23b7e510808044ae22054","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/news/dr.-body-won-sliver-awards-on-the-internet-and-challenge-cup-contest/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/dr.-body-won-sliver-awards-on-the-internet-and-challenge-cup-contest/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Zhenda Xu and Professor Song Guo for being awarded Sliver on \u0026ldquo;Internet+\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Challenge Cup\u0026rdquo; Contest.\n","tags":null,"title":"Dr. Body won Sliver Awards on the \"Internet+\" and \"Challenge Cup\" Contest","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Professor Song Guo for being elected as the 2020 CCF Distinguished Speaker.\nRelated Links\n","date":1611014400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694526836,"objectID":"53536b257541a2428530b16581e2acd1","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/news/professor-song-guo-was-elected-as-the-2020-ccf-distinguished-speaker/","publishdate":"2021-01-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/professor-song-guo-was-elected-as-the-2020-ccf-distinguished-speaker/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Professor Song Guo for being elected as the 2020 CCF Distinguished Speaker.\n","tags":null,"title":"Professor Song Guo was elected as the 2020 CCF Distinguished Speaker","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jie Zhang","Song Guo","Zhihao Qu","Deze Zeng","Yufeng Zhan","Qifeng Liu","Rajendra Akerkar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694917498,"objectID":"dee4689386eb61b3325535cfade05242","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/adaptive-federated-learning-on-non-iid-data-with-resource-constraint/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/adaptive-federated-learning-on-non-iid-data-with-resource-constraint/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Adaptive Federated Learning on Non-IID Data with Resource Constraint","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhaolong Ning","Shouming Sun","Xiaojie Wang","Lei Guo","Song Guo","Xiping Hu","Bin Hu","Ricky Y.

improvement of mobile devices (e.g., phones, tablets, drones, and autonomous vehicles), we are now witnessing an exciting revolution of the digital city. Specifically, with the popularity of 5G networks, video-sharing and live-streaming applications (e.g., TikTok, BIGO, and Twitch) are becoming increasingly widespread. Besides allowing individuals to share life experiences and moments with their followers, video-based applications could also be a promising tool for sensing complex and dynamic urban environments.\nWith the development of AI-empowered video processing techniques, the ubiquitous mobile camera network has the potential to go beyond the video-surveillance system to capture various risks in the complex and dynamic city environment. However, the edge device has limited computation resource compared to the desktop GPU and CPU, which brings new challenge for optimizing AI algorithm for executing on edge devices.\n  Resource-constraint Mobile Devices  Another major challenge is the heterogeneous of edge hardware. The AI models need to adapt to heterogeneous edge devices with significant ram and computation difference. The last challenge is view limitation. Since each edge device usually has a small field of view, it is very hard to capture an integrated scenario in the smart city. To support practical real-time risk detection, we must joint use multiple cameras to obtain abundant regional data.\n  Heterogeneous Mobile Devices  To solve the above challenges, we proposed a crowdsourced mobile video analytics framework for emerging real-time risk management in smart cities. Specifically, our framework consists of three components, including city digital twins, collaborative learning mechanism and real-time risk management.\n  A Crowdsourced Mobile Video Analytics Framework  First, the digital twin is a replica of a physical word, and this pairing of the digital and physical worlds allows analysis of data and monitoring of systems to head off problems before they even occur.\n  Interactive Digital Twins for Smart City  Second, the high-performance collaborative learning mechanism can provide a fast and robust computation capacity to support the real-time requests of the big data analytics in smart cities.\n  High Performance Collaborative Learning  Third, derived from the above two techniques, we develop a real-time risk management platform for proactive risk detection and self-defending emergency response.\n  Real –time Risk Management Platform  The research team will conduct in-depth cooperation with professors from the Department of Real Estate and the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering to promote in-depth research on the security of construction sites based on risk management technology based on edge intelligence.\n","date":1472256e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617257395,"objectID":"1a0fb0a6679c798a2bb7902f2ebcdd5e","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/project/emergency-risk-management-in-smart-city/","publishdate":"2016-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/emergency-risk-management-in-smart-city/","section":"project","summary":"With

academia and industry, since it can provide distributed ledgers with data transparency, integrity, and immutability to untrusted parties for various decentralized applications. However, it is still challenging for blockchain to deal with large-scale networks because of the limited scalability of the blockchain systems. Sharding is a novel blockchain architecture that is proved to significantly improve the scalability of blockchain. Its main idea is to divide blockchain nodes into small groups called shards, which can handle transactions in parallel. To exploit the shortages of blockchain sharding for real application environment, we conduct two research projects as follows.\nFirst, to deal with the serious performance degradation brought by cross-shard transactions, we propose a novel layered sharding architecture for blockchain and a cooperation-based layered sharding consensus. The basic idea is to allow shards to overlap, rather than isolating them completely, so that some nodes can locate in more than one shard. For cross-shard transactions, nodes located in the overlap of these shards can cooperative to verify, process and commit them directly and efficiently.\n  Blockchain and Training  Second, most existing blockchain sharding systems adopt a static sharding policy that cannot efciently deal with the dynamic environment in the blockchain system, i.e., joining and leaving of nodes, and malicious attack. We propose a novel dynamic sharding-based blockchain framework to achieve a good balance between performance and security without compromising scalability under a dynamic environment. For the framework, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based consensus is designed to acquire optimal sharding policies in a series of dynamic and high-dimensional environment states.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617176403,"objectID":"0e4ea299e3718dab0616766e1f2692e2","permalink":"https://peilab.netlify.app/project/new-architectures-and-methodologies-for-high-performance-sharding-blockchain/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/new-architectures-and-methodologies-for-high-performance-sharding-blockchain/","section":"project","summary":"Blockchain
