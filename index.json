However, these rollouts can be time-consuming and demand intensive human supervision to ensure safety. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach: developing a robot action simulator. This simulator can accurately emulate robot rollouts in a virtual environment, providing faster, safer, and more efficient evaluation of robot trajectories. Moreover, it can serve as a world model for planning robot actions, helping robots simulate and select optimal trajectories.\nContributions In this project, we present a groundbreaking action-to-video generation method, \\ourmethod, which predicts a video of a robot executing a sequence of actions given the initial frame and action sequence. Our work focuses on robot arms completing manipulation tasks, leveraging the cutting-edge generative capabilities of Diffusion Transformer technology.\n Novel Action-to-Video Generation Task: We introduce a task that predicts videos of robots performing a sequence of actions based on an initial frame and the action sequence. Innovative Method: We develop a novel method based on Diffusion Transformer, capable of generating accurate and realistic videos that strictly follow the input action sequence. Comprehensive Evaluation: We validate the effectiveness of RASthrough extensive experiments on three real-robot manipulation datasets: Language-Table, RT-1, and Bridge.  Significance The proposed RAS revolutionizes robot learning by providing a safer, faster, and more effective evaluation framework for robot trajectories. By accurately simulating interactions with objects in the environment, it enables significant advancements in real-world robot learning and manipulation tasks. Furthermore, RAS has the potential to transform various robotics applications, from industrial automation to assistive robotics, accelerating the development of intelligent and autonomous robots worldwide.\nContent in this demo Video: Robot Action Simulator demo \n","date":1715817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1715831307,"objectID":"5a2a508c42318cde2bc85caab21a7ae7","permalink":"https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/demos/l2t-robot-action-simulator/","publishdate":"2024-05-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/demos/l2t-robot-action-simulator/","section":"demos","summary":"Enable significant advancements in real-world robot learning and manipulation tasks","tags":null,"title":"🎥 Robot Action Simulator","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Background With the popularity of distributed systems, blockchain, and cryptography technologies, the era of Web 3.0 is forthcoming. Web 3.0 is expected to break the status quo that a few large Internet technology companies monopolize the World Wide Web. In Web 3.0, the content created by users is expected to be owned and controlled by the users. The value created will be fairly and transparently allocated according to the consensus of all users.\nContributions In this project, to promote and incentivize knowledge sharing and retrieving worldwide for Web 3.0, we will construct the first trustworthy and privacy-preserving decentralized knowledge graph system. The system will be composed of three layers. In the first layer, the users who want to share knowledge can store their data in the distributed storage system provided by HUAWEI Cloud. The data will be encrypted for the privacy of knowledge owners. In the second layer, we will construct an authenticated data structure for verifiable knowledge retrieving on the global knowledge graph shared by the users worldwide in a privacy-preserving manner. In the top layer, we will develop a decentralized social identity (DID) platform to regulate users' behaviors and encourage sharing of valuable knowledge for a sustainable ecosystem. Most importantly, all the above operations of storing, integrating, and retrieving knowledge will be supported by the Blockchain Service provided by HUAWEI Cloud; thus, they can be guaranteed transparently, tamper-proof, and openness.\nSignificance The project can return the ownership of knowledge to users and break the monopoly of large Internet technology companies.

Therefore, building a kilometer-scale global forecast model is a persistent pursuit in the meteorology domain. Active international efforts have been made in past decades to improve the spatial resolution of numerical weather models. Nonetheless, developing the higher resolution numerical model remains a long-standing challenge due to the substantial consumption of computational resources. Recent advances in data-driven global weather forecasting models utilize reanalysis data for model training and have demonstrated comparable or even higher forecasting skills than numerical models. However, they are all limited by the resolution of reanalysis data and incapable of generating higherresolution forecasts. This work presents FengWu-GHR, the first data-driven global weather forecasting model running at the 0.09◦ horizontal resolution. FengWu-GHR introduces a novel approach that opens the door for operating MLbased high-resolution forecasts by inheriting prior knowledge from a pretrained low-resolution model.

In addition, SwapPrompt applies a swapped prediction mechanism, which takes advantage of the representation capabilities of pre-trained models to enhance the online prompt via contrastive learning.\nAbstract Overview Test-time adaptation (TTA) is a special and practical setting in unsupervised domain adaptation, which allows a pre-trained model in a source domain to adapt to unlabeled test data in another target domain. To avoid the computation-intensive backbone fine-tuning process, the zero-shot generalization potentials of the emerging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP, CoOp) are leveraged to only tune the run-time prompt for unseen test domains. However, existing solutions have yet to fully exploit the representation capabilities of pre-trained models as they only focus on the entropy-based optimization and the performance is far below the supervised prompt adaptation methods, e.g., CoOp. In this paper, we propose SwapPrompt, a novel framework that can effectively leverage the self-supervised contrastive learning to facilitate the test-time prompt adaptation. SwapPrompt employs a dual prompts paradigm, i.e., an online prompt and a target prompt that averaged from the online prompt to retain historical information. In addition, SwapPrompt applies a swapped prediction mechanism, which takes advantage of the representation capabilities of pre-trained models to enhance the online prompt via contrastive learning. Specifically, we use the online prompt together with an augmented view of the input image to predict the class assignment generated by the target prompt together with an alternative augmented view of the same image. The proposed SwapPrompt can be easily deployed on vision-language models without additional requirement, and experimental results show that it achieves state-ofthe-art test-time adaptation performance on ImageNet and nine other datasets. It is also shown that SwapPrompt can even achieve comparable performance with supervised prompt adaptation methods.\n  ","date":1695340800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715229609,"objectID":"14684923b6855e59c570316699658df3","permalink":"https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/neuips_swapprompt_-test-time-prompt-adaptation-for-vision-language-models/","publishdate":"2023-09-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neuips_swapprompt_-test-time-prompt-adaptation-for-vision-language-models/","section":"project","summary":"In this paper, we propose SwapPrompt, a novel framework that can effectively leverage the self-supervised contrastive learning to facilitate the test-time prompt adaptation.

Employing generative refusals is crucial in upholding the ethical and copyright integrity of synthesized content, particularly when working with widely adopted diffusion models. Concept negation” presents a promising paradigm to achieve generative refusals, as it effectively defines and governs the model’s output space based on oncepts, utilizing natural language interfaces that are readily comprehensible to humans. However, despite the valuable contributions of prior research to the field of concept negation, it still suffers from significant limitations. The existing concept negation methods, which operate based on the composition of score or noise predictions from the diffusion process, are limited to independent concepts (e.g., “a blonde girl” without “glasses”) and fail to consider the interconnected nature of concepts in reality (e.g., “Mickey mouse eats ice cream” without “Disney characters”). Keeping the limitations in mind, we propose a novel framework, called PROTORE, to improve the flexibility of concept negation via test-time negative concept identification along with purification in the feature space. PROTORE works by incorporating CLIP’s language-contrastive knowledge to identify the prototype of negative concepts, extract the negative features from outputs using the prototype as a prompt, and further refine the attention maps by retrieving negative features. Our evaluation on multiple benchmarks shows that PROTORE outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various settings, in terms of the effectiveness of purification and the fidelity of generative images.\n  ","date":1695340800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715229609,"objectID":"7cd4bd37156cc950bbdcb9a1695763ea","permalink":"https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/neuips_towards-test-time-refusals-via-concept-negation/","publishdate":"2023-09-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neuips_towards-test-time-refusals-via-concept-negation/","section":"project","summary":"PROTORE works by incorporating CLIP’s language-contrastive knowledge to identify the prototype of negative concepts, extract the negative features from outputs using the prototype as a prompt, and further refine the attention maps by retrieving negative features.","tags":["Foundation Model"],"title":"(NeuIPS2023) Towards Test-Time Refusals via Concept Negation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Serverless ML inference is an emerging cloud computing paradigm for low-cost, easy-to-manage inference services.

We specifically propose a novel type of Trojan attack, where a maliciously designed PLM causes unexpected behavior in the database middleware. These Trojan attacks possess the following characteristics: (1) Triggerability: The Trojan-infected database middleware will function normally with normal input, but will likely malfunction when triggered by the attacker. (2) Imperceptibility: There is no need for noticeable modification of the input to trigger the Trojan. (3) Generalizability: The Trojan is capable of targeting a variety of downstream tasks, not just one specific task.

Introduction Modern machine learning (ML) applications are often deployed in the cloud environment to exploit the computational power of clusters. However, this in-cloud computing scheme cannot satisfy the demands of emerging edge intelligence scenarios, including providing personalized models, protecting user privacy, adapting to real-time tasks and saving resource costs. To conquer the limitations of conventional in-cloud computing, it comes the rise of on-device learning, which handles the end-to-end ML procedure mainly on user devices, and restricts unnecessary involvement of the cloud. Despite the promising advantages of on-device learning, implementing a high-performance on-device learning system still faces many severe challenges, such as insufficient user training data, backward propagation blocking and limited peak processing speed.\nIllustration: Conventional ML applications rely on the in-cloud learning paradigm, incurring essential drawbacks. Upgrading to the TinyML paradigm can effectively address these issues.\n2. Architecture Overview Observing the substantial improvement space in the implementation and acceleration of on-device learning systems, our group devote to designing high-performance TinyML architectures and relevant optimization algorithms, especially for embedded devices and microprocessors. Our research focuses on the software and hardware synergy of on-device learning techniques, covering the scope of model-level neural network design, algorithm-level training optimization and hardware-level instruction acceleration. Here, we present the architecture overview of our system design.\n  Architecture Overview  Illustration: an efficient TinyML system require a holistic design of the entire hierarchy, which can be resolved as five key research opportunities.\n3. Research Opportunities Here are five key research opportunities to implement our system. Please check the sub-folders for details.\n4. Achievements The on-device learning techniques can be employed in many emerging TinyML scenarios, where the system performance is often bounded by the limited hardware resources. Currently, our group has achieved breakthroughs in improving the computational capacity and designing domain-specific AI chips for task acceleration. These chips can be designed from the perspectives of model compression, few-shot learning, quantization-ware training, memory management and low-level instructions. We pursue the vision that helps researchers and developers optimize AI deployment without tedious code modifications.

A high- performance on-device learning system requires breaking the constraints of limited resources and alleviating computational overhead. Our preliminary work shows that employing the 8-bit fixed-point (INT8) quantization in both forward and back- ward passes over a deep model is a promising way to enable tiny on-device learning in practice. The key to an efficient quantization-aware training (QAT) method is to exploit the hardware- level enabled acceleration while preserving the training quality in each layer. However, off-the-shelf quantization methods cannot handle the on-device learning paradigm of fixed-point processing. To overcome these challenges, we propose to design an adaptive QAT algorithm, which jointly optimizes the computation of forward and backward passes. Besides, we need to build efficient network components to automatically counteract the quantization error of tensor arithmetic.

Existing methods mainly use convolutional neural networks as the backbone and get limited local features to recover the occluded part. Such an anti-occlusion pipeline often suffers from the challenges of self-occlusion scenery, where similar parts of occluders and occludes are ambiguous. In this case, we need to design a masked visual autoencoder for image processing and video streaming, which recovers occluded regions by extracting deep spatial information at a higher semantic level. This autoencoder can get better details inferred from global self-attention and thus improves accuracy. The gist is to train the autoencoder to extract key-point information from the key patches that are manually masked in a self-supervised manner to simulate the occlusion in video streaming. To choose the patches that should be masked, we design a high-capacity learnable gate that can extract contrastive representation, i.e., distinguish important feature regions and background regions, to generate a binary mask by randomly choosing a part of feature patches. We also propose an end-to-end pipeline for training and inference, which can effectively reduce the dependency of annotated occluded datasets and can be further applied to other visual tasks.

According to the survey and statistics of China Child Development Center, more than 20% teens have scoliosis. In addition to myopia and obesity, scoliosis has become the third biggest killer of youth health. According to some relevant survey data, 60% of teenagers have different degrees of posture problems. Early prevention and early treatment is the key of adolescent posture problems. Children who have mild scoliosis need to be monitored closely, usually with X-rays,to see if the curve is getting worse.\nAt present, the mainstream screening method is still manual detection, which has require patient naturally stands and bends at 90 degrees and the doctor makes a judgment based on the spinal line and morphological changes. However, such method has low efficiency and low accuracy and facing the severe shortage of physiotherapists.\nMeanwhile, during the COVID-19 epidemic, to help more people with rehabilitation needs realize remote screening and tracking and real-time AI monitoring of sports rehabilitation at home. A mobile-based posture screening algorithm and real-time exercise rehabilitation tracking algorithm are proposed.\nIn this project, we will design a 3D back image analysis method using commercial RGB-D to achieve low-cost, non-radiation, and sufficient accuracy of spine analysis and scoliosis screening. However, the analysis of the back image based on RGB-D is not simple and has the following three major challenges: (1) The back of the human body is an irregular curved surface, which is difficult to describe with some parametric models. (2) The point cloud image measured by commercial sensors is relatively sparse and has strong noise, and it is difficult to directly obtain the shape of the back. (3) The relationship between the back image and the spine shape is fuzzy.\n  Hardware Design and Compoments  To address these challenges, we propose an automated all-in-one machine that performs comprehensive and accurate analysis, evaluation, and diagnosis of human posture: analysis items are in addition to common body dimensions. It also includes three-dimensional reconstruction of human spine based on infrared, foot pressure analysis, XO legs, pelvic deformation analysis and other functions; it is a set of comprehensive posture evaluation system with clinical significance in the real sense.\n  Posture analysis algorithms  We also develop a Dr. Body APP, which uses AI algorithm to screen scoliosis, XO legs, high and low shoulders and other unhealthy postures through the photos of the back of the human body of the mobile phone for screening and severity classification; the use of a single photo of the human body for three-dimensional reconstruction of the human body for posture analysis and dimension measurement; Provide users with a variety of sports rehabilitation online courses, and record sports videos for intelligent action correction and analysis.\n  App record user data and provide personalized follow-up service  Innovation competition awards:\nFirst Prize of Hong Kong University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition (2020); Hong Kong Social Enterprise Competition (HKSEC2019) Intellectual Property Ambassador Award; \u0026ldquo;Weining Cup\u0026rdquo; International AI Medical Challenge First Prize (2019), et.\n","date":1648339200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714897695,"objectID":"8b154bffad168f104ad8525a2cbdbe98","permalink":"https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/radiation-free-spine-reconstruction-and-posture-analysis-techniques-with-3d-imaging/","publishdate":"2022-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/radiation-free-spine-reconstruction-and-posture-analysis-techniques-with-3d-imaging/","section":"project","summary":"Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that occurs most often during thegrowth spurt just before puberty.

Existing works for sharding, however, are limited by cross-shard transactions, since they need to split each cross-shard transaction into multiple sub-transactions, each of which costs a consensus round to commit. To deal with the serious performance degradation brought by cross-shard transactions. Therefore, we propose a novel layered sharding architecture for blockchain and a cooperation-based layered sharding consensus. The basic idea is to allow shards to overlap, rather than isolating them completely, so that some nodes can locate in more than one shard. For cross-shard transactions, nodes located in the overlap of these shards can cooperative to verify, process and commit them directly and efficiently.\nReference Pyramid: A Layered Sharding Blockchain System, INFOCOM 2021 (CCF-A).\n","date":1647216e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714897695,"objectID":"2215141cfca36a9058b79fec5c633cb8","permalink":"https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/scalable-consensus-layer/","publishdate":"2022-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/scalable-consensus-layer/","section":"project","summary":"Most existing blockchain systems adopt a static policy that cannot efciently deal with the dynamic environment in the blockchain system, i.e., joining and leaving of nodes, and malicious attack.

However, the existing PCN faces the challenge of sustainability, i.e., due to the imbalanced transfer in channels, the balance in one direction of channels gradually becomes exhausted, which makes the success ratio of payments in PCN suffers a major setback.

PSSE consist of a program of curve-specific exercise protocols which are individually adapted to a patients’ curve site, magnitude, and clinical characteristics. Specific PSSE are used to help relieve scoliosis symptoms. PSSE is not generalized physiotherapy exercises which are generic exercises usually consisting of low impact stretching and strengthening activities like yoga, Pilates and the Alexander technique but especially designed exercise for scoliosis patients that requires professional guidance. Wrong movement may cause severe damage to the spine again.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Exercise at specific medical centres with crowd around is risky. Smart phone, however, is now prevalence all over the world. Almost every smart phone contains at least one 2D camera that can capture video stream. If we can use this device to track patients’ movement, it may be way more convenient for doctors to guide the patients remotely.\nHuman pose estimation is one of the best matches of tracking patient movement at home.\nRecent years have witnessed learning-based human pose estimation getting popular in more scenarios with occlusions, where invisible areas for perception objects significantly affect accuracy. Existing methods mainly use convolutional neural networks as the backbone and get limited local features to recover the occluded part. Such an anti-occlusion pipeline often suffers from the challenges of self-occlusion scenery, where similar parts of occluders and occludees are ambiguous. In this case, we need to design a masked visual autoencoder for image processing and video streaming, which recovers occluded regions by extracting deep spatial information at a higher semantic level. This autoencoder can get better details inferred from global self-attention and thus improves accuracy. The gist is to train the autoencoder to extract key-point information from the joint tokens that are manually masked in a self-supervised manner to simulate the occlusion in video streaming. To use dataset more efficiently and extract more information from a single image, we generate several different positive samples simulating more occluded cases by randomly mask more patches in joint tokens. We also propose an end-to-end pipeline for training and inference, which can effectively reduce the dependency of annotated occluded datasets and can be further applied to other visual tasks. This pipeline can obtain a great computation saving with much fewer annotated datasets and hold a higher runtime performance over the SOTA ViT methods.\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714897695,"objectID":"c4fe3ef94d2a997b3319b4d2407b539f","permalink":"https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/anti-occlusion-human-pose-estimation-for-scoliosis-rehabilitation/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/anti-occlusion-human-pose-estimation-for-scoliosis-rehabilitation/","section":"project","summary":"Physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises (PSSE) have been proved to be effective in scoliosis rehabilitation.

becoming more and more popular. The key goal is to ensure the safety of drivers and passengers in the vehicle, and it is an essential step to realize autonomous driving at this stage.\nProposed Solution  Cognitive science, human facial expression, and eye tracking with AI Video Analytics Detection System. To build up an AI model for evaluating the driving mental factors and driving behavior of driver to provide the alert signal for human-computer interaction. Quantify Similarity of individual data to the Common Patterns Using Machine Learning Methods (i.e., log likelihoods of data being generated by models).  Methodology  Follow the previous research – In Psychology, HKU perform power analysis to determine the sample size (number of participants) required for detecting an effect, it have multiple predictors. Mental factors features were identified in the previous research assuming a medium effect size (alpha 0.05 and 80% Power). Big data collection in this project – Taxi Driver (at least 500 hours road driving video record) (e.g.: The Taxi driver who have been deducted the driving marks, in traffic jam situation). Feature labelling - facial expression, texture, eye tracking, facial muscle change. Train up the database.  Incentive Factors  Fanling Taxi Company (Mobile Shop Group Limited) supports this project, the camera can be installed in the Taxi to capture the real data (e.g.: angry or suddenly emotion change etc.) for analysis. Mr. Wong (Director of Fanling Taxi Company) stated that his team want to join the Taxi Service Commendations Scheme and seek the technology to improve their quality of service. He and his team are to thirst for joining the trial.

improvement of mobile devices (e.g., phones, tablets, drones, and autonomous vehicles), we are now witnessing an exciting revolution of the digital city. Specifically, with the popularity of 5G networks, video-sharing and live-streaming applications (e.g., TikTok, BIGO, and Twitch) are becoming increasingly widespread. Besides allowing individuals to share life experiences and moments with their followers, video-based applications could also be a promising tool for sensing complex and dynamic urban environments.\nWith the development of AI-empowered video processing techniques, the ubiquitous mobile camera network has the potential to go beyond the video-surveillance system to capture various risks in the complex and dynamic city environment. However, the edge device has limited computation resource compared to the desktop GPU and CPU, which brings new challenge for optimizing AI algorithm for executing on edge devices.\n  Resource-constraint Mobile Devices  Another major challenge is the heterogeneous of edge hardware. The AI models need to adapt to heterogeneous edge devices with significant ram and computation difference. The last challenge is view limitation. Since each edge device usually has a small field of view, it is very hard to capture an integrated scenario in the smart city. To support practical real-time risk detection, we must joint use multiple cameras to obtain abundant regional data.\n  Heterogeneous Mobile Devices  To solve the above challenges, we proposed a crowdsourced mobile video analytics framework for emerging real-time risk management in smart cities. Specifically, our framework consists of three components, including city digital twins, collaborative learning mechanism and real-time risk management.\n  A Crowdsourced Mobile Video Analytics Framework  First, the digital twin is a replica of a physical word, and this pairing of the digital and physical worlds allows analysis of data and monitoring of systems to head off problems before they even occur.\n  Interactive Digital Twins for Smart City  Second, the high-performance collaborative learning mechanism can provide a fast and robust computation capacity to support the real-time requests of the big data analytics in smart cities.\n  High Performance Collaborative Learning  Third, derived from the above two techniques, we develop a real-time risk management platform for proactive risk detection and self-defending emergency response.\n  Real –time Risk Management Platform  The research team will conduct in-depth cooperation with professors from the Department of Real Estate and the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering to promote in-depth research on the security of construction sites based on risk management technology based on edge intelligence.\n","date":1472256e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714897695,"objectID":"1a0fb0a6679c798a2bb7902f2ebcdd5e","permalink":"https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/emergency-risk-management-in-smart-city/","publishdate":"2016-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/emergency-risk-management-in-smart-city/","section":"project","summary":"With

academia and industry, since it can provide distributed ledgers with data transparency, integrity, and immutability to untrusted parties for various decentralized applications. However, it is still challenging for blockchain to deal with large-scale networks because of the limited scalability of the blockchain systems. Sharding is a novel blockchain architecture that is proved to significantly improve the scalability of blockchain. Its main idea is to divide blockchain nodes into small groups called shards, which can handle transactions in parallel. To exploit the shortages of blockchain sharding for real application environment, we conduct two research projects as follows.\nFirst, to deal with the serious performance degradation brought by cross-shard transactions, we propose a novel layered sharding architecture for blockchain and a cooperation-based layered sharding consensus. The basic idea is to allow shards to overlap, rather than isolating them completely, so that some nodes can locate in more than one shard. For cross-shard transactions, nodes located in the overlap of these shards can cooperative to verify, process and commit them directly and efficiently.\n  Blockchain and Training  Second, most existing blockchain sharding systems adopt a static sharding policy that cannot efciently deal with the dynamic environment in the blockchain system, i.e., joining and leaving of nodes, and malicious attack. We propose a novel dynamic sharding-based blockchain framework to achieve a good balance between performance and security without compromising scalability under a dynamic environment. For the framework, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based consensus is designed to acquire optimal sharding policies in a series of dynamic and high-dimensional environment states.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715193575,"objectID":"0e4ea299e3718dab0616766e1f2692e2","permalink":"https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/new-architectures-and-methodologies-for-high-performance-sharding-blockchain/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/new-architectures-and-methodologies-for-high-performance-sharding-blockchain/","section":"project","summary":"Blockchain

It enables distributed computing nodes to collaboratively train models without exposing their own data. In this research topic, we focus on overcoming the heterogeneity challenge (e.g., data heterogeneity, model heterogeneity) in FL.\n  Collaborative Learning  Efficient Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data: from the perspective of distribution characteristics of training data, FL can be categorized into two types, i.e., horizontal federated learning (HFL) and vertical federated learning (VFL). In HFL, we aim to propose efficient and robust learning scheme in resource-constrained computing environment by training a reinforcement learning model to adaptively tune the systematical parameters (e.g., the batch size in each client). Moreover, we explore the unbalanced features in VFL, the fundamental theories and algorithms are proposed to improve the learning efficiency and accuracy.\n  Knowledge Distillation  The Optimization of Federated Learning with Heterogenous Models: in this topic, we make effort on developing flexible and novel training framework by combining other techniques with FL, including (1) Knowledge Distillation (KD), (2) Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), (3) Neural Architecture Search (NAS), (4) Meta Learning, etc. Furthermore, we investigate the personalization in FL, which is also a good way to handle the above challenges.\n","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715193128,"objectID":"1d7be9bc8b8087397ed3c44e61d67690","permalink":"https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/federated-learning-in-resourced-constrained-mobile-edge-network/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/federated-learning-in-resourced-constrained-mobile-edge-network/","section":"project","summary":"Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising solution for future AI applications with strong privacy protection.
