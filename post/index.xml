&lt;p>Congratulations to Dr. Xu for being named as one of the &amp;ldquo;2023 Changshu Kuncheng Lake · Hurun China Under30s&amp;rdquo; - a list of China&amp;rsquo;s top young entrepreneurs under the age of 31. This year, a total of 189 young talents from 183 companies in 22 industries made the list, with an average age of 28, and a male-to-female ratio of 77:23. On average, these companies in operation for 4.7 years, have 180 employees and have raised a total of RMB 39 million in funding up to Series A.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of the companies on the list, 49% sell physical products while 51% sell software or services, with 51% being B2B and 49% being B2C. This list is in line with the Chinese government&amp;rsquo;s policy of promoting emerging and future industries, encouraging venture capital and equity investment, and optimizing the function of industrial investment funds. With over 11.7 million college graduates expected this year, it is important to strengthen policies and measures to promote youth employment and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish Dr. Xu and all the other young talents on the list continued success in their entrepreneurial endeavors, and hope they will contribute to the high-quality development of the Chinese economy.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This talk will focus on the field of &lt;strong>Edge Learning&lt;/strong>. Specifically, learning paradigms, fundamental theories, and enabling technologies for Edge Learning consist the main components of this tutorial. We will first explain the background and motivation for ML running at the network edge. Then, we will review the challenge issues existing in Edge Learning. Furthermore, we will provide an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and emerging key technologies for learning performance, security, privacy, and incentive issues toward training/inference at the network edge. Finally, we will discuss future research opportunities on Edge Learning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Offloading Game in Edge Computing, 2020 Best Paper Award for IEEE Transactions on Computers</title><link>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/news/a-deep-reinforcement-learning-based-offloading-game-in-edge-computing-2020-best-paper-award-for-ieee-transactions-on-computers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/news/a-deep-reinforcement-learning-based-offloading-game-in-edge-computing-2020-best-paper-award-for-ieee-transactions-on-computers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Congratulations to Professor Song Guo for 2020 Best Paper Award for IEEE Transactions on Computers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Canadian Academy of Engineering (CAE) is the national institution through which individuals, who have made outstanding contributions to engineering in Canada, provide strategic advice on matters of critical importance to Canada and to Canadians. The CAE is an independent, self-governing, and non-profit organization established in 1987. Fellows of the CAE are nominated and elected by their peers, in view of their distinguished achievements and career-long service. Fellows of the Canadian Academy of Engineering are committed to ensuring that Canada’s engineering expertise is applied to the benefit of all Canadians.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Canadian Academy of Engineering works in close cooperation with other senior academies in Canada and internationally. It is a founding member of the Council of Canadian Academies, along with the Royal Society of Canada (RSC) and the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences (CAHS). The CAE is also a member of the International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences (CAETS), which includes 31 similar national bodies around the world and the Partnership Group for Science and Engineering (PAGSE), an association of more than 20 Canadian organizations in science and engineering, whose mandate is to educate and inform federal Parliamentarians, decision makers and other leaders of the importance and significance of Canadian research and innovation to economic development, and society as a whole.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="about-the-internet-contest">About the &amp;ldquo;Internet+&amp;rdquo; Contest&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;Internet+&amp;rdquo; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition has been successfully held five times since 2015, and has become the world&amp;rsquo;s largest innovation and entrepreneurship competition for college students. In 2020, the competition drew 6.32 million participants (1.48 million teams) from 4,146 colleges and universities in 124 countries and regions. Over 1,000 professionals were invited to judge the competition and mentor the participants, among whom were investors, entrepreneurs, startup incubator mentors, and innovation and entrepreneurship education experts from China and abroad. Many high-quality projects stood out, gaining market visibility and investment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More than half of the top 100 universities in the world participated in this competition. The quality of the competition hit a record high, and the proportion of silver medals and above awards in the competition was about 0.03%.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="about-the-challenge-cup-contest">About the &amp;ldquo;Challenge Cup&amp;rdquo; Contest&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;Challenge Cup&amp;rdquo; contest, initiated in 1989, has attracted submissions by about one million students from colleges and universities in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. As a national guide and authoritative competition, the Challenge Cup is known as the &amp;ldquo;Olympics&amp;rdquo; of science and technology for Chinese college students. It is also a window to show Chinese college students' creativity in science and technology and an arena to select students of high quality.&lt;/p>
