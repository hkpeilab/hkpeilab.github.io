This shift has been greatly facilitated by the extensive external knowledge of PLMs. However, as PLMs are often provided by untrusted third parties, their lack of standardization and regulation poses significant security risks that have yet to be fully explored. This paper investigates the security threats posed by malicious PLMs to these emerging database middlewares. We specifically propose a novel type of Trojan attack, where a maliciously designed PLM causes unexpected behavior in the database middleware. These Trojan attacks possess the following characteristics: (1) Triggerability: The Trojan-infected database middleware will function normally with normal input, but will likely malfunction when triggered by the attacker. (2) Imperceptibility: There is no need for noticeable modification of the input to trigger the Trojan. (3) Generalizability: The Trojan is capable of targeting a variety of downstream tasks, not just one specific task. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of these Trojan attacks through experiments and analyze potential countermeasures and their limitations. Our findings could aid in the creation of stronger mechanisms for the implementation of PLMs in database middleware.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>(IoTJ)A Unified TinyML System for Multi-modal Edge Intelligence and Real-time Visual Perception.</title><link>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/unified-tinyml-system-main/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/unified-tinyml-system-main/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Modern machine learning (ML) applications are often deployed in the cloud environment to exploit the computational power of clusters. However, this in-cloud computing scheme cannot satisfy the demands of emerging edge intelligence scenarios, including providing personalized models, protecting user privacy, adapting to real-time tasks and saving resource costs. To conquer the limitations of conventional in-cloud computing, it comes the rise of on-device learning, which handles the end-to-end ML procedure mainly on user devices, and restricts unnecessary involvement of the cloud. Despite the promising advantages of on-device learning, implementing a high-performance on-device learning system still faces many severe challenges, such as insufficient user training data, backward propagation blocking and limited peak processing speed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Illustration:&lt;/strong> On-device learning is an emerging technique to pave the last mile of enabling edge intelligence, which eliminates the limitations of conventional in-cloud computing where dozens of computational capacities and memories are needed. A high- performance on-device learning system requires breaking the constraints of limited resources and alleviating computational overhead. Our preliminary work shows that employing the 8-bit fixed-point (INT8) quantization in both forward and back- ward passes over a deep model is a promising way to enable tiny on-device learning in practice. The key to an efficient quantization-aware training (QAT) method is to exploit the hardware- level enabled acceleration while preserving the training quality in each layer. However, off-the-shelf quantization methods cannot handle the on-device learning paradigm of fixed-point processing. To overcome these challenges, we propose to design an adaptive QAT algorithm, which jointly optimizes the computation of forward and backward passes. Besides, we need to build efficient network components to automatically counteract the quantization error of tensor arithmetic. We intend to implement our methods in Octo, a lightweight cross-platform system for tiny on-device learning, and keep improving its performance to support more realistic applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Unified Contrastive Representation Learner for Cross-modal Federated Learning Systems.</title><link>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/r3-cross-modal-representation-learner/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/r3-cross-modal-representation-learner/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="research-opportunity-3-a-unified-contrastive-representation-learner-for-cross-modal-federated-learning-systems">Research Opportunity 3: A Unified Contrastive Representation Learner for Cross-modal Federated Learning Systems&lt;/h3>

Existing methods (e.g., CLIP, visialGPT, VideoCLIP, and UniFormer) are resource-expensive, thus are not suitable for the realistic scenarios of deploying federated learning applications. Meanwhile, the single data modality of conventional FL systems significantly limits the scalability and applicability. Building an economical and efficient representation learner is the key issue to implement downstream tasks. This requires us to design a new cross-modal federated learning framework, which tackles the multimodality fusion of latent features and provides higher performance over the single-modal paradigms.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>(NeurIPS2022)Progressive Network Sparsification and Latent Feature Compression for Scalable Collaborative Learning.</title><link>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/r4-progressive-feature-compression/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/r4-progressive-feature-compression/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="research-opportunity-4-progressive-network-sparsification-and-latent-feature-compression-for-scalable-collaborative-learning">Research Opportunity 4: Progressive Network Sparsification and Latent Feature Compression for Scalable Collaborative Learning&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Illustration:&lt;/strong> In the edge intelligence environment, new data is continuously generated on user devices that cannot be aggregated at once due to privacy and energy concerns. These issues require us to develop new insights into traffic saving to build a communication-efficient collaborative learning paradigm. Unlike previous methods aiming at improving bandwidth utilization or using an unstructured pixel-wise compression, we jointly capture the channel and spatial-level feature redundancy, and conduct a hierarchical compression in these two levels to achieve a much higher traffic reduction ratio. Specifically, we need to design a more efficient feature compression method to leverage the pixel similarity, and reorganize the features into groups based on channel significance to prune the network. Meanwhile, we intend to calibrate the gradients of compressed features with a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the convergence rate. Such a co-design can provide a significant traffic reduction over existing methods while not sacrificing much model accuracy, achieving good training flexibility and communicational efficiency. We believe this work can contribute to the further development of edge intelligence applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>(AAAI2023)Masked Autoencoders for Occlusion-aware Visual Learners</title><link>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/r5-visual-anti-occlusion/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/r5-visual-anti-occlusion/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="research-opportunity-5-masked-autoencoders-for-occlusion-aware-visual-learners">Research Opportunity 5: Masked Autoencoders for Occlusion-aware Visual Learners&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Illustration:&lt;/strong> Recent years have witnessed learning-based video perception algorithms getting popular in more scenarios with occlusions, where invisible areas for perception objects significantly affect accuracy. Existing methods mainly use convolutional neural networks as the backbone and get limited local features to recover the occluded part. Such an anti-occlusion pipeline often suffers from the challenges of self-occlusion scenery, where similar parts of occluders and occludes are ambiguous. In this case, we need to design a masked visual autoencoder for image processing and video streaming, which recovers occluded regions by extracting deep spatial information at a higher semantic level. This autoencoder can get better details inferred from global self-attention and thus improves accuracy. The gist is to train the autoencoder to extract key-point information from the key patches that are manually masked in a self-supervised manner to simulate the occlusion in video streaming. To choose the patches that should be masked, we design a high-capacity learnable gate that can extract contrastive representation, i.e., distinguish important feature regions and background regions, to generate a binary mask by randomly choosing a part of feature patches. We also propose an end-to-end pipeline for training and inference, which can effectively reduce the dependency of annotated occluded datasets and can be further applied to other visual tasks. This pipeline can obtain a great computation saving with much fewer annotated datasets, and hold a higher runtime performance over the SOTA ViT methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Masked Autoencoders for Occlusion-aware Visual Learners</title><link>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/pages/intro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/pages/intro/</guid><description>&lt;ul>

Heterogeneous Data &amp; Resource Constraints: Batch Size Adaptation** -->
&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Federated learning (FL) has been widely recognized as a promising approach by enabling individual participants to cooperatively train a global model without exposing their own data. One of the key challenges in FL is that data distributions in different participants are usually non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID). For example, different areas can have very different disease distributions. Besides, the participants are usually resource-constrained with limited computational power, storage capacity, transmission range and battery. It is essential to design novel training framework to address above challenges. However, existing approaches either consider the optimization of server-side aggregation or focus on improving the client-side training efficiency, which only lead to sub-optimal performance. Therefore, we are going to investigate a new method to improve training efficiency of each client from the perspective of whole training process under the circumstances of non-IID data. In our proposed framework, both the local training and global aggregation are optimized by using a deep reinforcement learning agent to determine the batch size of each client according to the current state in each communication round.&lt;/p>

It is based on a blockchain platform in which the edge devices for distributed learning participate in the consensus and commit and receive transactions about the learning process including edge data collection, edge model weights, training results, etc. However, existing blockchains cannot be directly used for swarm learning because their consensus protocols often commit transactions in blocks, each of which requires minutes, while swarm learning produces massive data about the learning processes in real-time. Moreover, the edge devices are often unable to meet the hardware requirement of the existing blockchain consensus such as the computation-intensive mining in Proof-of-Work (PoW). Therefore, we are going to design a streaming blockchain system and smart contract engine for swarm learning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>(TKDE)Semantic Query and Index Layer in Semantic Blockchain Database</title><link>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/semantic-blockchain-database/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hkpeilab.netlify.app/project/semantic-blockchain-database/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Blockchain database is a new direction that constructs index on top of blockchain to provide rich query functionalities. The existing works are either insecure because the query process separates from the blockchain consensus, or inscalable because all the data needs to be stored in the block. Therefore, we propose an authenticated semantic database layer for blockchains. We design a hybrid on/off chain blockchain storage architecture in which the majority of blockchain storage is offloaded to the off-chain storage and a novel index structure named Merkle Semantic Trie (MST) is designed to be a secure and semantic bridge between on- and off-chain. Based on MST, MSTDB provides a variety of semantic query functions including multi-keyword query, range query, Top-K query, and cross-chain query. Besides, to improve the performance further, we design some index compression and query preprocessing techniques for our semantic database layer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As a promising solution to blockchain scalability, sharding divides blockchain nodes into small groups called shards, splitting the workload. Existing works for sharding, however, are limited by cross-shard transactions, since they need to split each cross-shard transaction into multiple sub-transactions, each of which costs a consensus round to commit. To deal with the serious performance degradation brought by cross-shard transactions. Therefore, we propose a novel layered sharding architecture for blockchain and a cooperation-based layered sharding consensus. The basic idea is to allow shards to overlap, rather than isolating them completely, so that some nodes can locate in more than one shard. For cross-shard transactions, nodes located in the overlap of these shards can cooperative to verify, process and commit them directly and efficiently.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Payment channel network (PCN) is the most promising off-chain technologies to support massive micro payments for blockchain. The technology has been deployed in a number of blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum. For example, Lightning Network, a PCN built on top of Bitcoin, is currently able to provide a network capacity of about 200 million dollars, which is doubling every year. However, the existing PCN faces the challenge of sustainability, i.e., due to the imbalanced transfer in channels, the balance in one direction of channels gradually becomes exhausted, which makes the success ratio of payments in PCN suffers a major setback. Therefore, for the fast payment layer in our system, we propose a sustainable PCN based on a new idea of asynchronous agreement and design a new rebalancing protocol which can constantly balance the network without channel freezing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Personal data produced from widely emerged cyberspace activities are expected to promote information dissemination and engagement, or even make business intelligence more powerful. However, the recent increase in social media incidents of illegal surveillance and data breaches raises questions about the current data ownership model, in which centralized applications collect and control large amounts of user data. We present SocialChain, which is a decentralized online data storage and sharing system based on blockchain that decouples user data and applications to return data ownership to the user. We adopt Personal Data Store to extend off-chain storage for the online data, set up an identity establishment mechanism that can support WebID-based authentication functions using a unique identity assignment (i.e., WebID) as well as certificateless cryptography, and design a general framework that leverages smart contracts to help securely store and share social data in an automated manner.&lt;/p>
