However, the dynamic query loads and heterogeneous user requirements severely challenge current transformer serving systems, which rely on pre-training multiple variants of a foundation model to accommodate varying service demands. Unfortunately, such a mechanism is unsuitable for large transformer models due to the prohibitive training costs and excessive I/O delay. We introduce OTAS, the first elastic serving system specially tailored for transformer models by exploring lightweight token management. We develop a novel idea called token adaptation. To cope with fluctuating query loads and diverse user requests, we enhance OTAS with application-aware selective batching and online token adaptation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="prototype-overview">Prototype Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We use Python to process the incoming queries and PyTorch to define the neural networks. We build the transformer model with timm library and insert two modules to add and remove the processing tokens at each layer. The system enables users to make a query and register tasks with two interfaces. The Make Query interface processes a query that comprises an image sample and various attributes. The Register Task interface saves the task parameters in the task model list and the corresponding latency and utility values in the task data list.&lt;/p>

This trend not only spurs the recent popularity of the Computing and Network Convergence (CNC), but also introduces an urgent need for the intelligentization of a management platform to coordinate changing resources and tasks in the CNC. Therefore, we present the concept of an intelligence-endogenous management platform for CNCs called CNC brain based on artificial intelligence technologies. It aims at efficiently and automatically matching the supply and demand with high heterogeneity in a CNC via four key building blocks, i.e., perception, scheduling, adaptation, and governance, throughout the CNC&amp;rsquo;s life cycle. Their functionalities, goals, and challenges are presented.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="prototype-overview">Prototype Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To examine the effectiveness of the proposed concept and framework, we also implement a prototype for the CNC brain based on a deep reinforcement learning technology. Also, it is evaluated on a CNC testbed that integrates three open-source and popular frameworks (OpenFaas, Kubernetes, and Ethereum) and a real-world business dataset provided by Microsoft Azure. The evaluation results prove the prototype&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness in terms of resource utilization and performance.

This shift has been greatly facilitated by the extensive external knowledge of PLMs. However, as PLMs are often provided by untrusted third parties, their lack of standardization and regulation poses significant security risks that have yet to be fully explored. This paper investigates the security threats posed by malicious PLMs to these emerging database middlewares. We specifically propose a novel type of Trojan attack, where a maliciously designed PLM causes unexpected behavior in the database middleware. These Trojan attacks possess the following characteristics: (1) Triggerability: The Trojan-infected database middleware will function normally with normal input, but will likely malfunction when triggered by the attacker. (2) Imperceptibility: There is no need for noticeable modification of the input to trigger the Trojan. (3) Generalizability: The Trojan is capable of targeting a variety of downstream tasks, not just one specific task. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of these Trojan attacks through experiments and analyze potential countermeasures and their limitations. Our findings could aid in the creation of stronger mechanisms for the implementation of PLMs in database middleware.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Warming Serverless ML Inference via Inter-function Model Transformation</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/warming-serverless-ml-inference-via-inter-function-model-transformation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/warming-serverless-ml-inference-via-inter-function-model-transformation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Serverless ML inference is an emerging cloud computing paradigm for low-cost, easy-to-manage inference services. In serverless ML inference, each call is executed in a container; however, the cold start of containers results in long inference delays. Unfortunately, most existing works do not work well because they still need to load models into containers from scratch, which is the bottleneck based on our observations. Therefore, we propose a low-latency serverless ML inference system called Optimus via a new container management scheme.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="prototype-overview">Prototype Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Optimus API and communication between clients and the gateway are implemented in REST API format. Clients can invoke an inference procedure by sending an HTTP request containing the model name and input data. Optimus stores the trained models in a Docker volume that is attached directly to each container created by the system. Models are deployed to the Docker volume in HDF format. Model structure information and model-to-model transformation planing are stored with the models in JSON format. On the host machine, a gateway service runs as the container manager. It uses the Docker SDK for Python to create, run, and remove containers in the local Docker environment. It also runs a Flask HTTP server that accepts client requests and sends them to containers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> Next-generation wireless networks are anticipated to provide connectivity for massive mobile devices and to enable a variety of innovative applications, which also generate enormous computing service demands with diverse and stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), as cutting-edge technology in next-generation networks, can utilize computing resources on the network edge to provide computing services for mobile devices within a radio access network. In this talk, we will investigate computing resource management for MEC, We will introduce two computation offloading and task scheduling schemes tailored for supporting representative use cases and network scenarios in next-generation wireless networks, including the Internet of Vehicles and mobile virtual reality video streaming. Data-model-driven resource management approaches will be exploited to facilitate low-latency and reliable computing services in complex and dynamic network environments.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and/or Internet of Vehicles (IoV) in general have attracted tremendous attention in recent years. They have been shown to be useful not only for traffic management and control, but also for diverse innovative applications to improve peopleâs quality of life. Observing that the most popular and omnipresent things in any city are vehicles, if each vehicle is equipped with powerful capability in communications, computing, storage, and intelligence (CCSI capability), such vehicles roaming around a city will automatically form a dynamic web of sensing, computing, communications, control, and/or edge intelligence, potentially providing an economically sound alternative solution to realizing the vision of smart city. In this talk, the speaker will discuss how to leverage connected CCSI enabled vehicles to take full advantage of both vehicular mobility and spectrum/computing opportunity to beef up the edge for various kinds of smart city services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/workshop/talk3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/workshop/talk3/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="task-scheduling-for-multi-access-edge-computing-in-irs-aided-vehicular-networks">Task Scheduling for Multi-Access Edge Computing in IRS-Aided Vehicular Networks&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has played an important role in realizing intelligent beyond 5G (B5G) vehicular networks. The computation tasks of intelligent applications can be offloaded to and processed by near-end-user MEC servers to meet strict latency requirements. However, the latency of provided services is dependent on MEC processor scheduling and millimeter wave (mmWave) transmission conditions for the urban B5G vehicular networks. To alleviate the mmWave signal attenuation caused by buildings, Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) has been regarded as efficient and prospective infrastructure. In this paper, we study the IRS-aided MEC-served vehicular networks and analyze the relationship between computation resource allocation and offloading policy at an intersection. Considering the vehicle mobility patterns, transmission conditions, and task sizes, we optimize the task scheduling by improving the allocation of limited processors and IRS resource. Moreover, the mutual interference among concurrent transmissions is taken into account. In this presentation, by assuming the moving directions available, a dynamic task scheduling algorithm is presented which considers both the communications and computations. The simulation results illustrate that the new scheme outperforms benchmark methods in terms of task offloading rate, computing rate, and finish rate for the IRS-aided MEC-served vehicular networks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/workshop/talk4/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/workshop/talk4/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="aiot-as-a-service--framework-opportunities-and-challenges">AIoT as a Service â Framework, Opportunities, and Challenges&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> With the increasing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and rapid advancements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, the integration of AI and IoT, widely referred as AIoT, is gaining momentum. Realizing AIoT will require massive investments in infrastructure, and lessons learned from network deployments point to the use of shared hardware and software resources that can be virtualized to support various services on demand, resulting in AIoT-as-a-Service (AIoTaaS). In this talk, we start with a review of the idea of Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS), leading to IoTaaS and AIaaS, which form the basis of AIoTaaS. We present a framework for AIoTaaS, which incorporates edge and cloud computing platforms to support the AI functionalities required for different services. Enabled by cloud and edge computing, AIoTaaS can effectively implement machine learning (ML) training and inference functions on cloud and edge devices with much less complexity to enable efficient and effective AI decision making in IoT and data analytics, especially in the area of streaming data and real-time analytics associated with edge computing networks. To implement AIoTaaS, interoperability between components at the device level, software level and platform level should be extended while optimizing system and network operations as well as extracting value from data. In the future, AIoTaaS integrated with 5G and blockchain will be leveraged to achieve more efficient IoT operations, improve human-machine interactions, and enhance data management and analytics, creating a foundation for pervasive AI services and applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/workshop/talk5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/workshop/talk5/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="edge-ai-and-mission-critical-industrial-applications">Edge-AI and Mission-critical Industrial Applications&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> In the past few decades, industrial automation has become a driving force in a wide range of industries. There is a broad agreement that the deployment of computing resources close to where data is created is more business-friendly, as it can address system latency, privacy, cost, and resiliency challenges that a pure cloud computing approach cannot address. This computing paradigm is now known as Edge Computing. Having said that, the full potential of this transformation for both of computing and data analytics is far from being realized. The industrial requirements are much more stringent than what a simple edge computing paradigm can deliver. This is particularly true when mission-critical industrial applications have strict requirements on real-time decision making, operational technology innovation, data privacy, and running environment. In this talk, I aim to provide a few answers by combining real-time computing strengths into modern data- and intelligence-rich computing ecosystems. I will also explore the topic of Edge AI, which is a process in which the Edge systems uses machine learning algorithms to process data generated by the userâs devices.&lt;/p>

Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Modern machine learning (ML) applications are often deployed in the cloud environment to exploit the computational power of clusters. However, this in-cloud computing scheme cannot satisfy the demands of emerging edge intelligence scenarios, including providing personalized models, protecting user privacy, adapting to real-time tasks and saving resource costs. To conquer the limitations of conventional in-cloud computing, it comes the rise of on-device learning, which handles the end-to-end ML procedure mainly on user devices, and restricts unnecessary involvement of the cloud. Despite the promising advantages of on-device learning, implementing a high-performance on-device learning system still faces many severe challenges, such as insufficient user training data, backward propagation blocking and limited peak processing speed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Illustration:&lt;/strong> Conventional ML applications rely on the in-cloud learning paradigm, incurring essential drawbacks. Upgrading to the TinyML paradigm can effectively address these issues.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Illustration:&lt;/strong> On-device learning is an emerging technique to pave the last mile of enabling edge intelligence, which eliminates the limitations of conventional in-cloud computing where dozens of computational capacities and memories are needed. A high- performance on-device learning system requires breaking the constraints of limited resources and alleviating computational overhead. Our preliminary work shows that employing the 8-bit fixed-point (INT8) quantization in both forward and back- ward passes over a deep model is a promising way to enable tiny on-device learning in practice. The key to an efficient quantization-aware training (QAT) method is to exploit the hardware- level enabled acceleration while preserving the training quality in each layer. However, off-the-shelf quantization methods cannot handle the on-device learning paradigm of fixed-point processing. To overcome these challenges, we propose to design an adaptive QAT algorithm, which jointly optimizes the computation of forward and backward passes. Besides, we need to build efficient network components to automatically counteract the quantization error of tensor arithmetic. We intend to implement our methods in Octo, a lightweight cross-platform system for tiny on-device learning, and keep improving its performance to support more realistic applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Unified Contrastive Representation Learner for Cross-modal Federated Learning Systems.</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/r3-cross-modal-representation-learner/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/r3-cross-modal-representation-learner/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="research-opportunity-3-a-unified-contrastive-representation-learner-for-cross-modal-federated-learning-systems">Research Opportunity 3: A Unified Contrastive Representation Learner for Cross-modal Federated Learning Systems&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Illustration:&lt;/strong> Contrastive representation learners have achieved great advantages for modern visual tasks. Existing methods (e.g., CLIP, visialGPT, VideoCLIP, and UniFormer) are resource-expensive, thus are not suitable for the realistic scenarios of deploying federated learning applications. Meanwhile, the single data modality of conventional FL systems significantly limits the scalability and applicability. Building an economical and efficient representation learner is the key issue to implement downstream tasks. This requires us to design a new cross-modal federated learning framework, which tackles the multimodality fusion of latent features and provides higher performance over the single-modal paradigms.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Progressive Network Sparsification and Latent Feature Compression for Scalable Collaborative Learning.</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/r4-progressive-feature-compression/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/r4-progressive-feature-compression/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="research-opportunity-4-progressive-network-sparsification-and-latent-feature-compression-for-scalable-collaborative-learning">Research Opportunity 4: Progressive Network Sparsification and Latent Feature Compression for Scalable Collaborative Learning&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Illustration:&lt;/strong> In the edge intelligence environment, new data is continuously generated on user devices that cannot be aggregated at once due to privacy and energy concerns. These issues require us to develop new insights into traffic saving to build a communication-efficient collaborative learning paradigm. Unlike previous methods aiming at improving bandwidth utilization or using an unstructured pixel-wise compression, we jointly capture the channel and spatial-level feature redundancy, and conduct a hierarchical compression in these two levels to achieve a much higher traffic reduction ratio. Specifically, we need to design a more efficient feature compression method to leverage the pixel similarity, and reorganize the features into groups based on channel significance to prune the network. Meanwhile, we intend to calibrate the gradients of compressed features with a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the convergence rate. Such a co-design can provide a significant traffic reduction over existing methods while not sacrificing much model accuracy, achieving good training flexibility and communicational efficiency. We believe this work can contribute to the further development of edge intelligence applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Masked Autoencoders for Occlusion-aware Visual Learners</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/r5-visual-anti-occlusion/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/r5-visual-anti-occlusion/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="research-opportunity-5-masked-autoencoders-for-occlusion-aware-visual-learners">Research Opportunity 5: Masked Autoencoders for Occlusion-aware Visual Learners&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Illustration:&lt;/strong> Recent years have witnessed learning-based video perception algorithms getting popular in more scenarios with occlusions, where invisible areas for perception objects significantly affect accuracy. Existing methods mainly use convolutional neural networks as the backbone and get limited local features to recover the occluded part. Such an anti-occlusion pipeline often suffers from the challenges of self-occlusion scenery, where similar parts of occluders and occludes are ambiguous. In this case, we need to design a masked visual autoencoder for image processing and video streaming, which recovers occluded regions by extracting deep spatial information at a higher semantic level. This autoencoder can get better details inferred from global self-attention and thus improves accuracy. The gist is to train the autoencoder to extract key-point information from the key patches that are manually masked in a self-supervised manner to simulate the occlusion in video streaming. To choose the patches that should be masked, we design a high-capacity learnable gate that can extract contrastive representation, i.e., distinguish important feature regions and background regions, to generate a binary mask by randomly choosing a part of feature patches. We also propose an end-to-end pipeline for training and inference, which can effectively reduce the dependency of annotated occluded datasets and can be further applied to other visual tasks. This pipeline can obtain a great computation saving with much fewer annotated datasets, and hold a higher runtime performance over the SOTA ViT methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Flexible Patch Skip for Real-time Visual Perception.</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/r2-lighweight-video-perception/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/r2-lighweight-video-perception/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Illustration:&lt;/strong> utilizing the temporal redundancy in video streams to construct efficient on-device video perception systems is a potential approach. We isolate the computation-saving challenge from video perception tasks and offer a task-independent acceleration approach that may be applied across a variety of runtime contexts. By separating acceleration and tasks, we plan to build novel quality-determining criteria for system design and provide an autonomous computation skipping approach to enable different video perception settings. We want to use a learnable gate in each convolution layer to decide which patches may be safely omitted without affecting model accuracy. The gate is optimized by a rigorous self-supervising approach that learns high-level semantics holistically to discern similarity and difference across frames.
Such a small gate architecture is compatible with common edge devices, and it can be used as a plug-and-play module in CNN backbones to provide patch-skippable networks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Efficient Federated Learning Framework on Heterogeneous Environment</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/efficient-federated-learning-framework/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/efficient-federated-learning-framework/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="research-overview">Research Overview&lt;/h2>

According to the survey and statistics of China Child Development Center, more than 20% teens have scoliosis. In addition to myopia and obesity, scoliosis has become the third biggest killer of youth health. According to some relevant survey data, 60% of teenagers have different degrees of posture problems. Early prevention and early treatment is the key of adolescent posture problems. Children who have mild scoliosis need to be monitored closely, usually with X-rays,to see if the curve is getting worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At present, the mainstream screening method is still manual detection, which has require patient naturally stands and bends at 90 degrees and the doctor makes a judgment based on the spinal line and morphological changes. However, such method has low efficiency and low accuracy and facing the severe shortage of physiotherapists.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, during the COVID-19 epidemic, to help more people with rehabilitation needs realize remote screening and tracking and real-time AI monitoring of sports rehabilitation at home. A mobile-based posture screening algorithm and real-time exercise rehabilitation tracking algorithm are proposed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this project, we will design a 3D back image analysis method using commercial RGB-D to achieve low-cost, non-radiation, and sufficient accuracy of spine analysis and scoliosis screening. However, the analysis of the back image based on RGB-D is not simple and has the following three major challenges: (1) The back of the human body is an irregular curved surface, which is difficult to describe with some parametric models. (2) The point cloud image measured by commercial sensors is relatively sparse and has strong noise, and it is difficult to directly obtain the shape of the back. (3) The relationship between the back image and the spine shape is fuzzy.&lt;/p>

It is based on a blockchain platform in which the edge devices for distributed learning participate in the consensus and commit and receive transactions about the learning process including edge data collection, edge model weights, training results, etc. However, existing blockchains cannot be directly used for swarm learning because their consensus protocols often commit transactions in blocks, each of which requires minutes, while swarm learning produces massive data about the learning processes in real-time. Moreover, the edge devices are often unable to meet the hardware requirement of the existing blockchain consensus such as the computation-intensive mining in Proof-of-Work (PoW). Therefore, we are going to design a streaming blockchain system and smart contract engine for swarm learning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heterogeneous Data \&amp; Resource Constraints- Batch Size Adaptation</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/batch-size-adaptation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/batch-size-adaptation/</guid><description>&lt;!-- ### **1. Heterogeneous Data &amp; Resource Constraints: Batch Size Adaptation** -->
&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Federated learning (FL) has been widely recognized as a promising approach by enabling individual participants to cooperatively train a global model without exposing their own data. One of the key challenges in FL is that data distributions in different participants are usually non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID). For example, different areas can have very different disease distributions. Besides, the participants are usually resource-constrained with limited computational power, storage capacity, transmission range and battery. It is essential to design novel training framework to address above challenges. However, existing approaches either consider the optimization of server-side aggregation or focus on improving the client-side training efficiency, which only lead to sub-optimal performance. Therefore, we are going to investigate a new method to improve training efficiency of each client from the perspective of whole training process under the circumstances of non-IID data. In our proposed framework, both the local training and global aggregation are optimized by using a deep reinforcement learning agent to determine the batch size of each client according to the current state in each communication round.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Instead of collaboratively train only one global for all clients, personalized federated learning (pFL) mechanisms are proposed to allow each client to train a customized model to adapt to their own data distribution. Researches over the past few years have applied the weighted aggregation manner to produce personalized models, where the weights are determined by calibrating the distance of the entire model parameters or loss values, and have yet to consider the layer-level impacts to the aggregation process, leading to lagged model convergence and inadequate personalization over non-IID datasets. We design a novel pFL training framework dubbed Layer-wised Personalized Federated learning (pFedLA) that can discern the importance of each layer from different clients, and thus is able to optimize the personalized model aggregation for clients with heterogeneous data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Blockchain database is a new direction that constructs index on top of blockchain to provide rich query functionalities. The existing works are either insecure because the query process separates from the blockchain consensus, or inscalable because all the data needs to be stored in the block. Therefore, we propose an authenticated semantic database layer for blockchains. We design a hybrid on/off chain blockchain storage architecture in which the majority of blockchain storage is offloaded to the off-chain storage and a novel index structure named Merkle Semantic Trie (MST) is designed to be a secure and semantic bridge between on- and off-chain. Based on MST, MSTDB provides a variety of semantic query functions including multi-keyword query, range query, Top-K query, and cross-chain query. Besides, to improve the performance further, we design some index compression and query preprocessing techniques for our semantic database layer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most existing pFL methods rely on model parameters aggregation at the server side, which require all models to have the same structure and size. Such constraints would prevent status quo pFL methods from further application in practical scenarios, where clients are often willing to own unique models, i.e., with customized neural architectures to adapt to heterogeneous capacities in computation, communication and storage space, etc. We seek to develop a novel training framework that can accommodate heterogeneous model structures for each client and achieve personalized knowledge transfer in each FL training round. Specifically, the aggregation procedure in original pFL is formulated into a personalized group knowledge transfer training algorithm, which enable each client to maintain a personalized soft prediction at the server side to guide the others' local training.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main objective of incentive is to motive data owners to participate in FL. A few of works have designed incentive mechanisms for FL, but these mechanisms only consider myopia optimization on resource consumption, which results in the lack of learning algorithm performance guarantee and long-term sustainability. We propose Chiron, an incentive-driven long-term mechanism for edge learning based on hierarchical deep reinforcement learning. First, our optimization goal combines learning-algorithms metric (i.e., model accuracy) with system metric (i.e., learning time, and resource consumption), which can improve edge learning quality under a fixed training budget. Second, we present a two-layer H-DRL design with exterior and inner agents to achieve both long-term and short-term optimization for edge learning, respectively.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As a promising solution to blockchain scalability, sharding divides blockchain nodes into small groups called shards, splitting the workload. Existing works for sharding, however, are limited by cross-shard transactions, since they need to split each cross-shard transaction into multiple sub-transactions, each of which costs a consensus round to commit. To deal with the serious performance degradation brought by cross-shard transactions. Therefore, we propose a novel layered sharding architecture for blockchain and a cooperation-based layered sharding consensus. The basic idea is to allow shards to overlap, rather than isolating them completely, so that some nodes can locate in more than one shard. For cross-shard transactions, nodes located in the overlap of these shards can cooperative to verify, process and commit them directly and efficiently.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Payment channel network (PCN) is the most promising off-chain technologies to support massive micro payments for blockchain. The technology has been deployed in a number of blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum. For example, Lightning Network, a PCN built on top of Bitcoin, is currently able to provide a network capacity of about 200 million dollars, which is doubling every year. However, the existing PCN faces the challenge of sustainability, i.e., due to the imbalanced transfer in channels, the balance in one direction of channels gradually becomes exhausted, which makes the success ratio of payments in PCN suffers a major setback. Therefore, for the fast payment layer in our system, we propose a sustainable PCN based on a new idea of asynchronous agreement and design a new rebalancing protocol which can constantly balance the network without channel freezing.&lt;/p>

Specifically, learning paradigms, fundamental theories, and enabling technologies for Edge Learning consist the main components of this tutorial. We will first explain the background and motivation for ML running at the network edge. Then, we will review the challenge issues existing in Edge Learning. Furthermore, we will provide an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and emerging key technologies for learning performance, security, privacy, and incentive issues toward training/inference at the network edge. Finally, we will discuss future research opportunities on Edge Learning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hybrid On-/Off-Chain Distributed Storage</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/mass-storage-layer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/mass-storage-layer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Personal data produced from widely emerged cyberspace activities are expected to promote information dissemination and engagement, or even make business intelligence more powerful. However, the recent increase in social media incidents of illegal surveillance and data breaches raises questions about the current data ownership model, in which centralized applications collect and control large amounts of user data. We present SocialChain, which is a decentralized online data storage and sharing system based on blockchain that decouples user data and applications to return data ownership to the user. We adopt Personal Data Store to extend off-chain storage for the online data, set up an identity establishment mechanism that can support WebID-based authentication functions using a unique identity assignment (i.e., WebID) as well as certificateless cryptography, and design a general framework that leverages smart contracts to help securely store and share social data in an automated manner.&lt;/p>

PSSE consist of a program of curve-specific exercise protocols which are individually adapted to a patientsâ curve site, magnitude, and clinical characteristics. Specific PSSE are used to help relieve scoliosis symptoms. PSSE is not generalized physiotherapy exercises which are generic exercises usually consisting of low impact stretching and strengthening activities like yoga, Pilates and the Alexander technique but especially designed exercise for scoliosis patients that requires professional guidance. Wrong movement may cause severe damage to the spine again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Exercise at specific medical centres with crowd around is risky. Smart phone, however, is now prevalence all over the world. Almost every smart phone contains at least one 2D camera that can capture video stream. If we can use this device to track patientsâ movement, it may be way more convenient for doctors to guide the patients remotely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Human pose estimation is one of the best matches of tracking patient movement at home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recent years have witnessed learning-based human pose estimation getting popular in more scenarios with occlusions, where invisible areas for perception objects significantly affect accuracy. Existing methods mainly use convolutional neural networks as the backbone and get limited local features to recover the occluded part. Such an anti-occlusion pipeline often suffers from the challenges of self-occlusion scenery, where similar parts of occluders and occludees are ambiguous. In this case, we need to design a masked visual autoencoder for image processing and video streaming, which recovers occluded regions by extracting deep spatial information at a higher semantic level. This autoencoder can get better details inferred from global self-attention and thus improves accuracy. The gist is to train the autoencoder to extract key-point information from the joint tokens that are manually masked in a self-supervised manner to simulate the occlusion in video streaming. To use dataset more efficiently and extract more information from a single image, we generate several different positive samples simulating more occluded cases by randomly mask more patches in joint tokens. We also propose an end-to-end pipeline for training and inference, which can effectively reduce the dependency of annotated occluded datasets and can be further applied to other visual tasks. This pipeline can obtain a great computation saving with much fewer annotated datasets and hold a higher runtime performance over the SOTA ViT methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Budget-Aware User Satisfaction Maximization on Service Provisioning in Mobile Edge

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="methodology">Methodology&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Follow the previous research â In Psychology, HKU perform power analysis to determine the sample size (number of participants) required for detecting an effect, it have multiple predictors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mental factors features were identified in the previous research assuming a medium effect size (alpha 0.05 and 80% Power).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Big data collection in this project â Taxi Driver (at least 500 hours road driving video record) (e.g.: The Taxi driver who have been deducted the driving marks, in traffic jam situation).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Feature labelling - facial expression, texture, eye tracking, facial muscle change.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Train up the database.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="incentive-factors">Incentive Factors&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fanling Taxi Company (Mobile Shop Group Limited) supports this project, the camera can be installed in the Taxi to capture the real data (e.g.: angry or suddenly emotion change etc.) for analysis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mr. Wong (Director of Fanling Taxi Company) stated that his team want to join the Taxi Service Commendations Scheme and seek the technology to improve their quality of service. He and his team are to thirst for joining the trial.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;Internet+&amp;rdquo; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition has been successfully held five times since 2015, and has become the world&amp;rsquo;s largest innovation and entrepreneurship competition for college students. In 2020, the competition drew 6.32 million participants (1.48 million teams) from 4,146 colleges and universities in 124 countries and regions. Over 1,000 professionals were invited to judge the competition and mentor the participants, among whom were investors, entrepreneurs, startup incubator mentors, and innovation and entrepreneurship education experts from China and abroad. Many high-quality projects stood out, gaining market visibility and investment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More than half of the top 100 universities in the world participated in this competition. The quality of the competition hit a record high, and the proportion of silver medals and above awards in the competition was about 0.03%.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="about-the-challenge-cup-contest">About the &amp;ldquo;Challenge Cup&amp;rdquo; Contest&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;Challenge Cup&amp;rdquo; contest, initiated in 1989, has attracted submissions by about one million students from colleges and universities in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. As a national guide and authoritative competition, the Challenge Cup is known as the &amp;ldquo;Olympics&amp;rdquo; of science and technology for Chinese college students. It is also a window to show Chinese college students' creativity in science and technology and an arena to select students of high quality.&lt;/p>

tablets, drones, and autonomous vehicles), we are now witnessing an exciting revolution of the digital city. Specifically, with the popularity of 5G networks, video-sharing and live-streaming applications (e.g., TikTok, BIGO, and Twitch) are becoming increasingly widespread. Besides allowing individuals to share life experiences and moments with their followers, video-based applications could also be a promising tool for sensing complex and dynamic urban environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the development of AI-empowered video processing techniques, the ubiquitous mobile camera network has the potential to go beyond the video-surveillance system to capture various risks in the complex and dynamic city environment. However, the edge device has limited computation resource compared to the desktop GPU and CPU, which brings new challenge for optimizing AI algorithm for executing on edge devices.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Another major challenge is the heterogeneous of edge hardware. The AI models need to adapt to heterogeneous edge devices with significant ram and computation difference. The last challenge is view limitation. Since each edge device usually has a small field of view, it is very hard to capture an integrated scenario in the smart city. To support practical real-time risk detection, we must joint use multiple cameras to obtain abundant regional data.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>
Heterogeneous Mobile Devices
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>To solve the above challenges, we proposed a crowdsourced mobile video analytics framework for emerging real-time risk management in smart cities. Specifically, our framework consists of three components, including city digital twins, collaborative learning mechanism and real-time risk management.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>First, the digital twin is a replica of a physical word, and this pairing of the digital and physical worlds allows analysis of data and monitoring of systems to head off problems before they even occur.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Second, the high-performance collaborative learning mechanism can provide a fast and robust computation capacity to support the real-time requests of the big data analytics in smart cities.&lt;/p>

+0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/new-architectures-and-methodologies-for-high-performance-sharding-blockchain/</guid><description>&lt;p>Blockchain draws tremendous attention from academia and industry, since it can provide distributed ledgers with data transparency, integrity, and immutability to untrusted parties for various decentralized applications. However, it is still challenging for blockchain to deal with large-scale networks because of the limited scalability of the blockchain systems. Sharding is a novel blockchain architecture that is proved to significantly improve the scalability of blockchain. Its main idea is to divide blockchain nodes into small groups called shards, which can handle transactions in parallel. To exploit the shortages of blockchain sharding for real application environment, we conduct two research projects as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, to deal with the serious performance degradation brought by cross-shard transactions, we propose a novel layered sharding architecture for blockchain and a cooperation-based layered sharding consensus. The basic idea is to allow shards to overlap, rather than isolating them completely, so that some nodes can locate in more than one shard. For cross-shard transactions, nodes located in the overlap of these shards can cooperative to verify, process and commit them directly and efficiently.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Second, most existing blockchain sharding systems adopt a static sharding policy that cannot efciently deal with the dynamic environment in the blockchain system, i.e., joining and leaving of nodes, and malicious attack. We propose a novel dynamic sharding-based blockchain framework to achieve a good balance between performance and security without compromising scalability under a dynamic environment. For the framework, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based consensus is designed to acquire optimal sharding policies in a series of dynamic and high-dimensional environment states.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Protection of big data privacy</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/protection-of-big-data-privacy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/protection-of-big-data-privacy/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Rank-based image watermarking method with high embedding capacity and robustness</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/rank-based-image-watermarking-method-with-high-embedding-capacity-and-robustness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/rank-based-image-watermarking-method-with-high-embedding-capacity-and-robustness/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Big data analytics for emergency communication networks: A survey</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/big-data-analytics-for-emergency-communication-networks-a-survey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/big-data-analytics-for-emergency-communication-networks-a-survey/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mobility Prediction Based Joint Stable Routing and Channel Assignment for Mobile Ad Hoc Cognitive Networks</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/mobility-prediction-based-joint-stable-routing-and-channel-assignment-for-mobile-ad-hoc-cognitive-networks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/mobility-prediction-based-joint-stable-routing-and-channel-assignment-for-mobile-ad-hoc-cognitive-networks/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Joint Optimization of Task Scheduling and Image Placement in Fog Computing Supported Software-Defined Embedded System</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/joint-optimization-of-task-scheduling-and-image-placement-in-fog-computing-supported-software-defined-embedded-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/joint-optimization-of-task-scheduling-and-image-placement-in-fog-computing-supported-software-defined-embedded-system/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A General Communication Cost Optimization Framework for Big Data Stream Processing in Geo-distributed Data Centers</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/a-general-communication-cost-optimization-framework-for-big-data-stream-processing-in-geo-distributed-data-centers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/a-general-communication-cost-optimization-framework-for-big-data-stream-processing-in-geo-distributed-data-centers/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A Truthful Double Auction for Device-to-device Communications in Cellular Networks</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/a-truthful-double-auction-for-device-to-device-communications-in-cellular-networks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/a-truthful-double-auction-for-device-to-device-communications-in-cellular-networks/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fault-Tolerant Visual Secret Sharing Schemes without Pixel Expansion</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/fault-tolerant-visual-secret-sharing-schemes-without-pixel-expansion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/publications/fault-tolerant-visual-secret-sharing-schemes-without-pixel-expansion/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Federated Learning in Resourced Constrained Mobile Edge Network</title><link>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/federated-learning-in-resourced-constrained-mobile-edge-network/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peilab.netlify.app/project/federated-learning-in-resourced-constrained-mobile-edge-network/</guid><description>&lt;p>Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a promising solution for future AI applications with strong privacy protection.

&lt;p>Efficient Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data: from the perspective of distribution characteristics of training data, FL can be categorized into two types, i.e., horizontal federated learning (HFL) and vertical federated learning (VFL). In HFL, we aim to propose efficient and robust learning scheme in resource-constrained computing environment by training a reinforcement learning model to adaptively tune the systematical parameters (e.g., the batch size in each client). Moreover, we explore the unbalanced features in VFL, the fundamental theories and algorithms are proposed to improve the learning efficiency and accuracy.&lt;/p>
